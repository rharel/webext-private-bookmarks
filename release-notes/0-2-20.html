        <ul>
            <li>This release should provide stability improvements and bug fixes.</li>
            <li>New locales: German (de) and Italian (it)</li>
            <li>The experimental sync feature has been removed. This due to Firefox now imposing a strict limit on the size of data extensions are allowed to sync. That limit is too small to support the sync feature for all users.</li>
